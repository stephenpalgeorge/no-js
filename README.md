# NO.JS

No.js is an experiment in building modern web UI with as little javascript as possible (preferably none!). This is not because JS is bad, far from it, but rather because HTML and CSS are awesome, and we want to celebrate them.

[Here's the website](https://nojs-ui.surge.sh/) <br />
[And here's the first tutorial blog](https://medium.com/the-code-less-travelled/no-js-navigation-component-9c924a16fc5)

Components are built with Nunjucks and Sass. If you want to contribute, clone the repo, build something and PR it. Use the existing components as a guide and reach out if there are any questions.
