            The No.js philosophy is to leverage the full power of HTML and CSS
            and build as much of the modern web as possible without using JS. This is as much
            out of curiosity as it is out of any philosophical convictions.

                    I'm not really campaigning to abandon JavaScript, I'm just saying that it's interesting
                    to experiment with how much interactivity you can conjure up without it.

                <p class="lead">"No.js" is really only referring to the final code that is rendered in the browser.</p>
                <p>
                    I'm fully aware that, in the source code, I'm using tools like Nunjucks and gulp - although this is, of
                    course, optional.
<!--                    I also show these components implemented in popular JS frameworks-->
<!--                    (principally <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>), but again it's really the <em>output code</em>-->
<!--                    that I'm interested in - how much JS is being shipped to the browser?-->
