# No.js - Philosophy

## Building the web with as little JavaScript as possible

### TL;DR

How much of the web can you with just HTML and CSS? This is the start of a series where we will explore which components, and how much interactivity we can achieve without a single line of JS.

Lo-fi, slow-food...no-js.

I'll be upfront about it: I'm a front-end developer by day, so of course I'm not out here campaigning to do away with JavaScript; I love JavaScript (and she pays the bills).

But for the love I have for JavaScript, I love HTML and CSS every bit as much. And when you augment them with preprocessors like [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and templating languages like [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) or [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), I think they really are incredible, powerful tools.

## The penny-drop

The 'A-ha' moment for me was when I was building a small React app (just a personal project) and implementing a responsive nav. As expected, the mobile version was a hamburger icon that, when clicked, would toggle the visibility of the navigation "drawer", that contained the actual menu items. I've done this many times, and in several different ways. But then I saw a video; I have to apologise because there won't be a link appearing here, I can't remember who it was or when, or where to even start looking for it - but I did see it. In this video, the developer in question implemented a mobile navigation with not a single line of JavaScript. *You can achieve this exact component with nothing more than HTML and CSS*.

That got me thinking: how much could I do with just those 2 languages? How many components, how much interactivity could I muster from markup and styles alone?

This series is an exploration into that question - I'll walk you through component builds and then talk you through how JS can be sprinkled on top again for a final (progressively enhancing) flourish. In the next episode, I'll walk you through that aforementioned example of a mobile navigation. See you there.
